# Simple Python Weather CLI

Instead of taking 2 milliseconds to check the weather on my phone, i decided to make a python weather cli using  [WeatherAPI](www.weatherapi.com).
## Usage
Execute the main script with your WeatherAPI token and the city of your choice as arguments.
  

     python3 main.py [TOKEN_ID] [City]
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     REGISTER ON WEATHERAPI TO GET YOUR API KEY
